#Leeloo

Leeloo is a job scheduling server written in Node.js using a MongoDB database to maintain and run routine tasks. Commands can currently be issued through the command line or with `require("leeloo")` after a local install. I'll be cleaning up the client/server interface at some point.

'Leeloo' is also a possible phonetic spelling for 'LILO', which computer science nerds may know means 'Last In Last Out'; a queue.
